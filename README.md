project_title: project-grange

problem:
rural communities are struggling to survive, let alone prosper. with the evolution of technology, high gas prices, BIG
agriculture and corporate sprawl the heartland of america is at risk. in the not so distant past local
communities communicated through party lines, local radio, TV and newspapers. however, due to the rapid expansion of
technology there are no more newspapers, people listen to satellite radio instead of local radio and there are very
few local community television stations. Communication and collaboration in rural communities have been down-sized to the
bulletin board at the local coffee shop or super-market. talk about going back in time... furthermore, rural
communities struggle with identity. technology has certainly created new challenges for rural communities, and it
also presents many opportunities.

background:
history does indeed repeat itself and the challenges facing rural communities are not new. following the end of the
Civil War (1867) a cooperative farmers movement swept rural America in the mid-1870s. farmers' protested in the South
and Midwest states against economic hardship and exploitation. and the Grange Halls were born. in general, Grange Halls
were simple structures that embodied rural construction techniques popular in the first quarter of the nineteenth
century. Most featured wood framing with shiplap or clapboard siding and were built by local volunteer labor. during
this time hundreds of local Grange chapters formed throughout the country.

the Grange was originally organized for social and educational purposes. however the Grange’s early success was based
on mobilizing farmers politically against railroad and grain elevator monopolies that controlled the process of
marketing agricultural goods. the so-called Granger states, which included Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin,
were in the upper Mississippi Valley, the region where conflict between farmers and railroads over transportation
costs was particularly sharp in the 1870’s. to combat the corporations’ power, the Grangers organized, often with
the aid of local merchants and consumers, Granger or anti-monopoly parties, and they campaigned successfully for
laws establishing state commissions to regulate railroads and warehouses. Although challenged, the constitutionality
of such laws was upheld by the U. S. Supreme Court decision in Munn vs. Illinois (1876).

the Granage set up credit unions, insurance programs, and other services that really affected farmers' lives. in
addition to providing a place for locals to get together for dances, holiday picnics, and town meetings they
sponsored helped sparsely populated communities forge a sense of identity.

solution:
Provide rural communities with a modern grange that fulfills the role of the grange hall from the turn of the century.
in the spirit of the grange hall this project aims to use technology to deliver a "simple structure" community that
can be accessed from a computer or other mobile device.

mission:
to provide a path to increase economic opportunity and improve the quality of life for all rural Americans.

objective:
create an online grange hall. use modern technology to provide a space for people and their community to
band together to promote the economic and political well-being of their community and agriculture.

* Community includes: the people, municipality, small business, home-based business, farm, ranch, education, creatives,
etc.

goals:
- have an intuitive, responsive website that integrates UX best practices.
- design a modern look and feel that caters to a rural demographic.
- establish a position as the leader in using technology to catalyze rural economic growth and development.
- obtain five percent increase in web traffic each month for the first three months following launch.
- have a 10% user interaction increase by the end of the 1st quarter.
- have web driven revenue.

approach:
I. Scope
- project scope.
- assess requirements.
- develop stories.
- create wireframes.

requirements:
- user authentication, user must create an account to post.
- must accommodate multiple types of users.
- search capabilities.
- section 508 compliance.
- any person with an account can post information.


******* gSchool_project_information ******

gSchool_project_requirements:
- 2 commits per week at least
- User authentication (this can be only an Admin side to put content in)
- 2-4 models that interrelate
    * One many to many relationship
    * one belongs to relationship
- Something visually flashy - images, maps, a slick javascript widget etc…
- API integration that pulls data from another website / pushes data to other sites (like Twitter, Text messages etc…)
- An API that others can use to get your data
    * this can be in the form of an API for your JavaScript
- Email integration - probably using SendGrid via the Heroku addon - could be as simple as a forgot-password email
- All the things we do in class:
    * good commit messages
    * tests
    * really good readmes
- Something explaining what’s interesting about the project
    * could be on a separate about page or on github pages
- A cool algorithm.
    * This can be something like taking tweets and replacing certain words to make them funny, or a calculation that requires more than simple math.
- It looks decent on a mobile device
- A realtime component - like an auto-updating page (like tracker has)
- Open-sourced under the Apache v2 License.
- Has decent CSS and structure
